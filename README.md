# lerna-travis-semantic-release
An experiment to see how Lerna 3+ works with Semantic Release and Travis CI

## Making Commits

checkin your commits.

```bash
npm run commitlint
``` 

## TODOs

Some things to do after this prototype is done.

* Rewrite the Semantic Release and lerna analyzer package in TypeScript
